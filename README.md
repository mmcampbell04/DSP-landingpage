Landing page for "Dead Squirrel Productions", the side-gig retirement project of family friend: a video production company posting family trips to Youtube.

I was given carte-blanche for the content and design, and the DSP "brand" is whimsical and irreverent, which I aimed to build into the site. Design inspiration courtesy of Jhey Thompkins' website & Egghead CSS art course.

Copy written by me.

What I've learned so far:

- how to create my own dark mode toggle and use local storage
- how to adapt someone else's dark mode toggle (Coder, Coder);
- how to debug my own original dark mode toggle...
- how to create different CSS illustrations and animations (big thanks to CodePen)
- a better understanding of ES6 import/export modules
- how to set a fixed/sticky navbars
- how incredibly (and frustratingly!) straightforward it is to use a range slider with a slidehow
