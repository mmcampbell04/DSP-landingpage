# Dead Squirel Productions

## Description

This is the landing page for "Dead Squirel Productions", the side-gig/retirement hobby of a family member: a 'video production company' posting family trips to Youtube.

I was given carte-blanche for the content and design, and the DSP "brand" is whimsical and irreverent, which I aimed to build into the site.

This is the first full webpage I designed (though with inspiraiton from Jhey Thompkins, Frontend Joe, Coder Coder) and developed. I wanted it to be a playground and test field for my CSS skills. I built a lot of custom animations & CSS artwork courtesy of far too many hours on Codepen.

This is still a work in progress but the live site is here: https://mmcampbell04.github.io/DSP-landingpage/

## What I've learned so far:

- how to create my own dark mode toggle and use local storage
- how to adapt someone else's dark mode toggle (thanks Coder, Coder!);
- how to debug my own original dark mode toggle...
- how to create different CSS illustrations and animations (big thanks to CodePen)
- a better understanding of ES6 import/export modules
- how to set a fixed/sticky navbars
- how incredibly (and frustratingly!) straightforward it is to use a range slider with a slidehow
- how to use JS to skip to specific sections in the html and then how the scroll-margin-top in CSS is so much easier
- how to build custom forms

## Still to-do:

- fix a few broken Youtube links (or add in missing links)
- improve accessibility - now that the content & layout is done, I intend to go over accessibility guidelines with a fine tooth comb
- add functionality to the contact page so a message can send. Maybe with PHP, maybe not...
